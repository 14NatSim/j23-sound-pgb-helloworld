April 16, 2014 Finally Success!




I have got working using Phonegap Build 3.4 html5 audio play tags.

Also using the Device plugin I have got working polyphonic playing of multiple .mp3, .wav or .m4a


Quick playing of the files using .play then .pause as a pre-load (This should be put in an onDeviceReady function)
Record of audio to the Download folder or the root of the sdcard. Very finicky about naming on the record. Flexible on playback.
