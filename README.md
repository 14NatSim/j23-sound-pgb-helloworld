========================

Sound in phonegap may not yet be fully html5 compliant. This is a test to see what used to work and what still does work.


April 9, 2014. Strange but for URL sounds html5 seems to work with my samsung galaxy S3, but none- of my old phoneagp media stuff seems to work. Having no luck accessing the sdcard or local sounds.

Will keep trying




Presently can not get sounds working. got them going fine on phonegap 2.4 having no luck at the moment with 3.4 
April 8, 2013. Will try again later.
